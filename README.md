# Exploring Neural Text Simplification

## Abstract
We present the first attempt at using sequence to sequence neural networks to model text simplification (TS). Unlike the previously proposed automated methods, our neural text simplification (NTS) systems are able to simultaneously perform lexical simplification and content reduction. An extensive human evaluation of the output has shown that NTS systems achieve good grammaticality and meaning preservation of output sentences and higher level of simplification than the state-of-the-art automated TS systems. We train our models on the [Wikipedia corpus](http://ssli.ee.washington.edu/tial/projects/simplification) containing _good_ and _good partial_ alignments.

## Simplify Text | Generate Predictions (no GPUs needed)
1. OpenNMT dependencies
    1. [Install Torch](http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html)
    2. Install additional packages:
    ```bash
	luarocks install tds
    ```
2. Checkout this repository including the submodules:
```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/zeppdev/Text-Simplification.git
```
3. Download the pre-trained released models [NTS](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_pjS_ZjPfT9dEtrbV85UXhSelU) and [NTS-w2v](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_pjS_ZjPfT9ZTRfSFp4Ql92U0E) (NOTE: when using the released pre-trained models, due to recent changes in third party software, the output of our systems might not be identical to the one reported in the paper.)
```bash
   python src/download_models.py ./models
```
4. Run translate.sh from the scripts dir:
```bash
   cd src/scripts
   ./translate.sh
```
5. Check the predictions in the results directory:
```bash
   cd ../../results_NTS
```
6. Run automatic evaluation metrics
    1. Install the python requirements (only nltk is needed)
    ```bash
       pip install -r src/requirements.txt
    ```
    2. Run the evaluate script
    ```bash
       python src/evaluate.py ./data/test.en ./data/references/references.tsv ./predictions/
    ```

## The Content of this Repository
#### ./src 
- **download_models.py** a script to download the pre-trained models. The models are released to be usable on machines with or without GPUs. They can't be used to continue the training session. In case the download script fails, you may use the direct links for [NTS](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_pjS_ZjPfT9dEtrbV85UXhSelU) and [NTS-w2v](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_pjS_ZjPfT9ZTRfSFp4Ql92U0E)
- **train_word2vec.py** a script that creates a word2vec model from a local corpus, using gensim
- **SARI.py** a copy of the [SARI](https://github.com/cocoxu/simplification) implementation
- **evaluate.py** evaluates BLEU and SARI scores given a source file, a directory of predictions and a reference file in tsv format
- **./scripts** - contains some of our scripts that we used to preprocess the data, output translations, and create the concatenated embeddings
- **./patch** - the patch with some changes that need to be applied, in case you may want to use the latest checkout of OpenNMT. 
Alternatively, you may use [our forked code](https://github.com/senisioi/OpenNMT/) which comes directly as a submodule.

#### ./configs
Contains the OpenNMT config file. To train, please update the config file with the appropriate data on your local system and run (NB! Needs to be run from OpenNMT directory!). 
```bash
	th train.lua -config $PATH_TO_THIS_DIR/configs/NTS.cfg
```
#### ./predictions
Contains predictions from previous systems (Wubben et al., 2012), (Glavas and Stajner, 2015), and (Xu et al., 2016), and the generated predictions of the NTS models reported in the paper:
- NTS_default_b5_h1 - the default model, beam size 5, hypothesis 1
- NTS_BLEU_b12_h1 - the BLEU best ranked model, beam size 12, hypothesis 1
- NTS_SARI_b5_h2 - the SARI best ranked model, beam size 12, hypothesis 1

- NTS-w2v_default_b5_h1 - the default model, beam size 5, hypothesis 1
- NTS-w2v_BLEU_b12_h1 - the BLEU best ranked model, beam size 12, hypothesis 1
- NTS-w2v_SARI_b12_h2 - the SARI best ranked model, beam size 12, hypothesis 2

#### ./data 
Contains the training, testing, and [reference](https://github.com/cocoxu/simplification) sentences used to train and evaluate our models.
